/**
 * @brief The BandwidthTracker class tracks network bandwidth usage over a sliding time window (default 10s).
 *
 * Byte totals are grouped into fixed time interval buckets (default 250ms). This provides an element of smoothing
 * and deals well with spikes.
 *
 * GetAverageMbps() is calculated using the 25% most recent fully completed buckets. The default settings will
 * return an average of the past 2.5s of data, ignoring the in-progress bucket. Using only 2.5s of data for the
 * average provides a good balance of reactivity and smoothness.
 *
 * GetPeakMbps() returns the peak bandwidth seen during any one bucket interval across the full time window.
 *
 * All public methods are thread safe. A typical use case is calling AddBytes() in a data processing thread while
 * calling GetAverageMbps() from a UI thread.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   BandwidthTracker bwTracker(10, 250); // 10-second window, 250ms buckets
 *   bwTracker.AddBytes(64000);
 *   bwTracker.AddBytes(128000);
 *   double avg = bwTracker.GetAverageMbps();
 *   double peak = bwTracker.GetPeakMbps();
 * @endcode
