(Partial) History of PB/Xcode projects:
2009-09-21 - Updated for 64-bit (Snow Leopard) Universal Binaries.
	Switched to 10.4 minimum requirement.
	Now dynamic linking Mac OS X bundled freetype directly in /usr/X11R6. (We used to just copy this one into our package since older versions of Mac OS X didn't ship with the library.)
	Reason: We no longer statically link libfreetype.a into the binary because Apple stopped supplying a libfreetype.a in the 10.5 and 10.6 SDKs.
	For static library target, you will need to link against libfreetype.dylib for your final app.

2006-01-31 - First entry in history. Updated for Universal Binaries. Static library of libfreetype has been updated by copying the version Apple provides from the 10.4u SDK.
